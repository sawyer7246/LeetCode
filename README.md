# LeetCode
My leetcode algorithm 


##`E`Palindrome Number 
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.


##`E`Contains Duplicate  
Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

##`M`Find Peak Element   
A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
Given an input array where num[i] ≠ num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.
The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.
You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -∞.
For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

##`E`Power of Two  
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

##`M`Reverse Words in a String
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. 

For example,
 Given s = "the sky is blue",
 return "blue is sky the". 

##`E`ZigZag Conversion 
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string text, int nRows);。
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

#`E`Two Sum
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2



#`E`Add Two Numbers
You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
