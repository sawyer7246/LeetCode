My leetcode algorithm 


##`E`Palindrome Number 
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.


##`E`Contains Duplicate  
Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

##`M`Find Peak Element   
A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
Given an input array where num[i] ≠ num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.
The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.
You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -∞.
For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

##`E`Power of Two  
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.
