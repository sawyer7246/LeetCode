##Delete Node in a Linked List 

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

##解题思想
###想法1
1.好久没写了，最近开始做内部的项目，争取明天搞定。
2.这题看了半天没大搞懂，之后看了别人discuss才大概了解了，原来是给定一个待删除元素的上一个，然后删除它，简单的把下一个指针指向下下一个就解决了，值付个下一个。
