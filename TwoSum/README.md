#Two　Sum
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2

##解题思想
###想法1
1.每次加入新元素的时候，计算需要的另外一个数字，如果存在就返回。


###ps:这个算法第一次是Int数组没加[] 之后再次提交，一遍通过！爽哉~
